# Vehicle_Plotter_App_using_HC05_xbee
This uses GPS to get the position co-ordiantes and broadcast this information in a local area using Zigbee via Bluetooth.
When other systems receive this broadcast information, the application puts a marker in the location.
Thus, everyone can see nearby vehicles on a map and can avoid accidents and busy junctions.

We are developing it to include more features like showing the least busy path, speed of all vechicles etc.
